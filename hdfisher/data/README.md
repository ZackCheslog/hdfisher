# __The latest version of the CMB-HD mock data is located in the `hdMockData` [repository](https://github.com/CMB-HD/hdMockData)__. 

The `hdfisher/data` directory _only_ contains the original version `'v1.0'` of the CMB-HD data used in MacInnis et. al. (2023). The latest version can be accessed with the `Data` class of `hdfisher/dataconfig.py`, but the files themselves are located in the `hdMockData` repository [here](https://github.com/CMB-HD/hdMockData). We also provide Python functions with `hdMockData` that can be used to easily access the files.
